# Evolution

According to the theory of Evolution, all living organisms on earth evolved (through a process of mutation and natural selection) from a single first living organism. This application is based on a heavily simplified computer simulation of that evolutionary process.

The application will take as input a text file that contains a trace/log of a sequence of evolutionary events. Each line of the file contains a separate evolutionary event and these events must be applied in order from first/top line to last/bottom line. Each species is identified by an integer id, with the first species given a species id of 1. Each species has a distinct genome - the genetic material or DNA associated with the organism. The application tracks the genome for each species as evolution proceeds. For this simulation, we are only interested in the sections of DNA that directly control the form and function of the organisms. We call these sections of DNA genes. Each gene consists of a sequence of DNA (or nucleotides), which can be represented computationally as character strings over an alphabet of size 4: A for Adenine, C for Cytosine, G for Guanine and T for Thymine. Each species therefore has a genome that consists of a set of genes, with each gene represented as a string of characters. Each gene of a species is given an integer id to identify it. This gene id is only unique within a given species; i.e. gene 1 of species 1 is different from gene 1 of species 2 and so on.
